# ðŸ”§ Development Configuration Notes

## CORS Issue Resolution

**Problem**: The frontend was showing "Backend Offline" despite the backend being operational due to CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) restrictions.

**Root Cause**: The Flask backend was not configured with proper CORS headers to allow requests from `http://localhost:5173` (frontend) to `http://localhost:5000` (backend).

**Solution**: Configured Vite development server with a proxy to forward API requests.

### Vite Proxy Configuration

In `vite.config.js`:
```javascript
server: {
  proxy: {
    '/api': {
      target: 'http://localhost:5000',
      changeOrigin: true,
      rewrite: (path) => path.replace(/^\/api/, ''),
    },
  },
}
```

### API Service Update

In `src/services/apiService.js`:
```javascript
// Changed from: 'http://localhost:5000'
// Changed to:   '/api'
const API_BASE_URL = import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE_URL || '/api';
```

### How It Works

1. Frontend makes requests to `/api/health` instead of `http://localhost:5000/health`
2. Vite proxy intercepts requests to `/api/*`
3. Removes `/api` prefix and forwards to `http://localhost:5000/*`
4. No CORS issues because the request appears to come from the same origin

### Testing

- Direct backend: `curl http://localhost:5000/health` âœ…
- Proxied endpoint: `curl http://localhost:5173/api/health` âœ…
- Frontend integration: Now working without CORS errors âœ…

### UI Improvements Made

1. **Enhanced Header**:
   - Gradient background (blue-50 to indigo-100)
   - Better typography and spacing
   - Improved shadow and border styling

2. **Improved Upload Zone**:
   - 3D visual effects with gradients
   - Hover animations and transforms
   - Better visual feedback for drag states
   - Increased padding and modern styling

3. **Enhanced Cards**:
   - Gradient backgrounds
   - Hover effects with elevation
   - Rounded corners and modern shadows

4. **Better Status Indicators**:
   - More detailed console logging for debugging
   - Enhanced error handling and reporting

### Result

- âœ… Backend status now shows "Online" correctly
- âœ… Beautiful, modern UI with smooth animations
- âœ… Professional appearance suitable for production
- âœ… Responsive design for all screen sizes
- âœ… Enhanced user experience with visual feedback
